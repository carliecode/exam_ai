# Data Engineer Take Home Assessment

This repository contains solutions to the Data Engineer Take Home Assessment. The assessment is divided into two parts, each focusing on different aspects of data engineering tasks. I used SQL Server as my target database but focused where possible on ANSI SQL.

## Project Structure

- `Part 1/`: Contains solutions for Part 1 of the assessment.
- `Part 2/`: Contains solutions for Part 2 of the assessment, along with a log file for the last question.

## Part 1: Python Coding Tasks

### Task Descriptions

1. **Reverse the Sentence**: Reverse a given sentence without using an inbuilt function.
2. **Remove Vowels**: Write a program that removes all vowels from a given string.
3. **Count Occurrence of Letters**: Count the occurrence of each letter in a string and store it in a dictionary.
4. **Left Rotate a String**: Left rotate a string by k values.
5. **Working with APIs**: Retrieve weather data for a list of cities using a public API and create a summary report.

## Part 2: SQL Tasks

### Task Descriptions

1. **Create All Combinations of Cricket Matches**: Generate all combinations of cricket matches without repeating the same pair in reverse order.
2. **Student Results**: Find the result of each student in each subject, showing null in marks if a student did not attend the exam.
3. **Most Recent Order for Each Customer**: Find the most recent order for each customer using only the most recent order, without using multiple correlated subqueries.
4. **Generate a Range Without Loops**: Generate a range starting from 1 to a given number without using loops.
5. **Hierarchical Data**: Generate level and breadcrumb outputs for hierarchical data. (Log file included)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL Server or any compatible database
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

### Running the Python Code

1. Navigate to the `part1/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to view the code and its execution results.

### Executing SQL Queries

1. Import the provided SQL scripts into your SQL Server.
2. Run the scripts to create the necessary tables and execute the queries.

## Log File

- A log file has been included for the last question in Part 2, which details the execution steps and results.

## Acknowledgments

- OpenWeather API for weather data.
